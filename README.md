## ‚ú® Features

-   **Zero-Gravity Physics**: Experience momentum-based movement in a frictionless space environment. The core mechanic is a magnetic force you control, not direct movement.
-   **Procedural Level Generation**: Every playthrough offers a unique challenge with dynamically generated levels that increase in difficulty.
-   **Interactive UI Panels**:
    -   **Draggable**: Move the UI and Instructions panels anywhere on the screen.
    -   **Minimizable**: Shrink panels into small icons to clear up screen space.
    -   **Closable**: Hide panels completely for an unobstructed view, with toggle buttons to bring them back.
-   **Dynamic Game Objects**:
    -   **Walls**: Normal walls and repulsive magnetic walls.
    -   **Hazards**: Deadly spikes and black holes with a gravitational pull.
    -   **Teleporters**: Instantly jump between two points in the level.
-   **Power-Ups**: Collect temporary boosts like **Force Shield**, **Speed Boost**, **Magnet Amplifier**, and **Energy Refill**.
-   **Stunning Visuals**: A rich space theme with a dynamic starfield, glowing particle effects for all major interactions, and polished animations.
-   **Procedural Audio**: Sound effects are generated in real-time using the Web Audio API for a lightweight and responsive experience.
-   **Responsive & Touch-Ready**: Fully playable on both desktop and mobile devices, with complete touch support for controls and UI manipulation.
